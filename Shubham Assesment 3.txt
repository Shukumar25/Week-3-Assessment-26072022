A) select display_name,viewcount from posts inner join users on (posts.id=users.id) order by viewcount desc limit 5;

B) select avg(users.age) as A from users group by age;

C) select displayname,creation_date from users inner join posts on (users.id=posts.id) order by creationdate asc limit 5;

D) select displayname,commentcount,reputation from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) order by reputation desc limit 5;

E) 

F) Find the owner name and id of user whose post has got maximum no. of view counts so far.

select owneruserid,displayname,viewcount from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) order by viewcount desc limit 5;

G) select title,owneruserid,displayname,commentcount from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) order by commentcount desc limit 1;

H) select loc ,count(id) as B from users group by loc order by B desc limit 1;

I) (i) select loc, count(answercount) from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) where loc like '%India%' group by loc; 

  (ii) select loc, count(post_type) from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) where loc like '%India%' group by loc;

 (iii) select loc, count(commentcount) from users inner join posts on (posts.id=users.id) where loc like '%India%' group by loc;
